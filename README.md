## About
This course will teach you how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals and provides you with a brief introduction to a variety of topics in computational problem solving . This course is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity.

## Topics covered
* Advanced programming in Python 3
* Knapsack problem, Graphs and graph optimization
* Dynamic programming
* Plotting with the pylab package
* Random walks
* Probability, Distributions
* Monte Carlo simulations
* Curve fitting
* Statistical fallacies

## Description
This project targets the cource offered version during the winter semester of 2019. It includes my implementation of the coding exercises, problem sets, and exams. Additionally, I have coded along some of the lectures and added my own notes and comments. Version of Python used: [3.7.4](https://docs.python.org/3.7/)
